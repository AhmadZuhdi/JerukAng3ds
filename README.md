## ï»¿Citra Enhanced is being rebranded to "Mandarin" and completely being rebuilt from scratch 

**We were not happy with the current state of the project and recent events made us completely rethink the way we approach this fork of Citra**

A couple of points we want to change

- We will still focus on performance hacks which are considered "too unstable"

But they will usually be togglable and will not mess with the stability of the emulator anymore for users who don't wanna use them

- Focus on proper code review/authoring

We don't want a repeat of past actions, and others as well. We will be extra careful with code authoring in particular (One of our members is known to have issues around that aspect so we'll try our best. If you have any problems with a license-breaking commit, please contact us on the `issues` page immediately)
   

**You can still access the old code of "Citra-Enhanced" using the legacy branch (I don't know why you would want to though) and the old releases will still be available to download for now**

We should be back and running in a few days. Thank you for your patience (especially the devs)
